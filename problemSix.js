// Problem 6
 //Imagine that you have two arrays, each with single letter strings in the arrays. For example:

// ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'd'];
// ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'e', 'c', 'c', 'g'];

// Write some JavaScript to create a new array based on the overlapping items 
//and the number of times the overlap occurs. For example, our new array would look like this:

// ['a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'b'];

// To explain further, the string 'a' appears 3 times in the frist array 
// and 2 times in the second array. Therefore, there are only 2 overlaps. 
// The string 'c' appears 1 time in the first array and 2 times in the scrond array. 
// Therefore, there is only 1 overlap. 
// The same pattern follows with 'b'. Our new array is based on those overlaps.

let arrayOne = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'd'];

let arrayTwo = ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'e', 'c', 'c', 'g'];

// let overlap = arrayOne.filter(x => arrayTwo.includes(x));

overlap = (arr1, arr2) => {

}
